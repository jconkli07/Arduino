## Finite LED Blinker

For this assignment I added to my earlier LED blinking program by making it blink only 5 times, and display how many times it blinked. After this assignment I feel that I understand if statements and variables pretty well. I also am more comfortable with printing to the monitor and making an LED blink now that I've has more practice.
