## Finite LED Blinker

For this assignment I added to my earlier LED blinking program by making it blink only 5 times, and display how many times it blinked. After this assignment I feel that I understand if statements and variables pretty well. I also am more comfortable with printing to the monitor and making an LED blink now that I've has more practice.

## LED Blink Revisited

For this assignment I made an LED fade in and out forever and displayed a line of x's that showed how bright the LED was. There were more x's when the LED was bright and fewer when it was dark. This assignment was relatively easy, but I had a problem because I was plugging my a wire into the wrong pin, but I figured it out and fixed it. This helped me with learning the wiring, after this assignment I feel like I understand it a lot better.

## Hello Functions

For this assignment I used the servo and ultrasonic sensor for the first time. I made the sevo turn at different speeds depending on how far an object was from the sensor. Google was really helpful with this assignment, it helped me with the wiring and how to get the distance from an ultrasonic sensor. I feel that I understand functions pretty well after this asignment, and I also feel relatively confident with using the ultrasonic sensor and servo, whereas before I had little to no experience.

## NewPing

For this assignment I decided to use the NewPing library to make an LED glow at a different brightness depending how far away an object was from the ultrasonic sensor. I felt like this was kind of a cross between the LED Blink Revisited and Hello Functions assignments. Using the library was a bit tricky at first but then I figured out the issues and got it working. It was much easier to code the LED because I have done it couple times before, after this assignment I feel more comfortable with using libraries.

## Photoresistor

In this assignment I made a night light that varies in brightness depending on the light level in the room. I used the photoresistor to get the value for the amount of light in the room. The value was higher when it was lighter and lower when it was darker. I then used this value to set an LED to a certain brightness (with analogWrite) depending on how bright it was. When the room is very bright the LED is off but as it gets darker the LED turns on and slowly gets brighter the darker it gets. This assignment helped me learn how to use the photoresistor, I didn't have any significant problems with the coding or wiring.
