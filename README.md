## Finite LED Blinker

For this assignment I added to my earlier LED blinking program by making it blink only 5 times, and display how many times it blinked. After this assignment I feel that I understand if statements and variables pretty well. I also am more comfortable with printing to the monitor and making an LED blink now that I've has more practice.

## LED Blink Revisited

For this assignment I made an LED fade in and out forever and displayed a line of x's that showed how bright the LED was. There were more x's when the LED was bright and fewer when it was dark. This assignment was relatively easy, but I had a problem because I was plugging my a wire into the wrong pin, but I figured it out and fixed it. This helped me with learning the wiring, after this assignment I feel like I understand it a lot better.
